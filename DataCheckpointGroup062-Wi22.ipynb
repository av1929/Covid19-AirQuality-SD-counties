This dataset contains 6 columns of  data: date, county, state, fips, cases and  deaths. The FIPS column  crefers to a FIPS code, a geographic identifier that determines the location of the county the data was pulled from and makes it easy to associate with other datasets"

This data set is organized alphabetically in rows by state, each county is assigned to its state accordingly and also arranged in alphabetical order.  There are a total of 1162 rows in this data set and out of the total of rows however 1144 rows contain observations of air pollutants for specific counties.  This dataset contains 13 columns from left to right as follows: State, County, County FIPS Code, 2010 population, CO, Pb, NO2 AM (ppb), NO2 hr (ppb), O3, PM10, PM2.5 Wtd AM, PM2.5 hr, and SO2.  These show the highest number of such pollutant in the given area."
