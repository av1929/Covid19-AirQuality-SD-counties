This dataset contains 6 columns of  data: date, county, state, fips, cases and  deaths.

There are a total of 1162 rows in this data set and out of the total of rows however 1144 rows contain observations of air pollutants for specific counties.  This dataset contains 13 columns from left to right as follows: State, County, County FIPS Code, 2010 population, CO, Pb, NO2 AM (ppb), NO2 hr (ppb), O3, PM10, PM2.5 Wtd AM, PM2.5 hr, and SO2.
